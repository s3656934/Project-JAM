									<p>Hi, my name is Ruddro Ashrafi, currently studying at RMIT with this current student number s3723367. My email address is s3723367@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is originally from Bangladesh but I was born in Japan. Currently studying at Information Technology at RMIT and graduated from Dandenong High School in 2017 with a goal to achieve a degree in Information Technology. I have the ability to speak three different languages which include English, Bengali, and Hindi. My favourite thing to do during spare times or weekends is to play cricket, since it’s my favourite sport and always bring the happiness in me. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>My interest in IT is to do network engineering, explore all the different pathways to become a successful network engineer. My interest in IT started when I was in year 10, I fell in love with computers and playing around with them which sparked an interest in me to become a network engineer. I even learnt how to turn off other computers using Wi-Fi networks through the use of command prompt. I don’t have much experience in IT since I did it only in year 9 and 10, but I still enjoy it since I use my computer daily to daily basis, sometimes I enjoy programming instead of just watching videos. I chose to come RMIT University since I heard that it was one of the best universities in Melbourne and ever since then my goal was to go RMIT. During my studies, I expect to learn programming and networking skills to develop my skills in order to achieve my dream. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>The ideal job I will be looking for after I finish my degree in information technology will be something that is related towards network engineering. There is an example of a job that I am looking forward to which is: https://www.seek.com.au/job/35825686?type=standard&userqueryid=d3a220a0aa70d262f5549942d73d1c8f-5216515  
•	The position of this job is to work as a network engineer and most of the time I will be working alone but may include teamwork sometimes. This position is appealing to me since it satisfies my dreams of becoming a network engineer. The skills required for this job is providing network based SME advice to internal and external stake holders and designing and building network solutions. The qualifications required is:
•	Cisco certifications
•	Experience with routing and switching (layer 2/layer 3 switching) 
•	High level communication skills
•	Experience with MPLS, OSPF and BGP

Currently, I have only have high level communication skills other than that no other qualifications or experiences. My plan to obtain these skills using the buildings I have now, I am currently still not sure, but I want to get these qualifications and experiences from RMIT.

									<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>The first test I took was the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator which gave me a variety of results which said that I am a traditionalist, who likes stability and consistency, I value my hard work and responsibility, I make sure that I always keep promises to others, I like to keep organized and appreciate schedules and to-do lists and appreciate structure and like people to play by the rules. These results give a positive to image towards my personality. The second test I took was the online learning style test which gave back three different results for three different categories. For auditory and visual, I got 30% for both of them but for tactile I got 40% which shows that I am more a tactile person. The final test I took was of my own choosing called the 16personalities, which said that I am 92% extraverted, 72% observant, 71% feeling, 61% judging and 60% assertive. These results show that my behaviour and influence towards a team member is positive and friendly to make a good social environment. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
									<p>My project idea is that I want to develop a smartphone app, by using the MIT App Inventor. This project will include all the tools to create an app that I want to develop which will be about a cricket game. I love playing cricket, since I’m a cricketer myself; I want to develop a cricket game that will get all the cricket lovers to download the app. The obstacles I’m anticipating are coding errors and simple errors but hopefully I can overcome that and make the app successful. I am very passionate about cricket, it is a sport I’ve been playing since I was a young boy, now an adult yet still playing since I cherish this sport. The IT innovation I want to see are like cricket games that look very realistic and makes the gamers feel like as if they are literally playing the game in real life. A virtual reality type of gaming app, which looks very real, this is the type of innovation I want to see in the future. Projects that will help me develop skills qualified for my ideal job will be projects like something that is related to networking since that is my choice of line for my ideal job. I need all the knowledge I can get from to qualify for my ideal job since there is a lot of requirements to get into the job. There are a lot of cricket lovers in Australia since they’re national side is very good in cricket and always look for younger talents so that means the app will get a lot of downloads following the statistics of cricket lovers in Australia. The features of the app will be the visuals, the quality, the colour, the attractive approach and easy to use app. These features always play a major role in whether this app will sell a lot over the globe since nowadays people look for quality. I want the app to have a vibrant approach so it attracts them from the start of the app, making the icon look attractive is also a huge deal since they look at the icon and see if it’s good looking or not. This app will be free and available to apple and android app store, so both users can use it on their phones. I will make sure the app is suitable for both operating systems since I want to make sure the games will be fast with no lags or glitches.  I will make sure that there will be no advertisements on the app while playing the game, since to some users it’s very annoying and distracting. Even for me, as an apple user, all the apps with those advertisements always popping up during my game, it’s very annoying and distracting during the game which leads to negative results. So the tool we are going to be using is the MIT App Inventor since it will start off with android app store to see the results then move onto apple slowly. The script that will be used is Java, since MIT is supported by java and Kawa scheme, but I am going to use java since I have experience with Java from working with it in RMIT. All the skills that are required that it should have an to-the point content, defined set of features, think like a user, effective user interface, testing it after release of the app and delay should never be a problem. These are some of the skills required for my project. To find the skills, it will be a challenge but I will try my best to get this done to fulfil my dream. If the project is successful I am expecting to get a lot of users across the globe, since it will be made carefully for the users to enjoy. The original problem will be solved by using the right code words to get no mistakes and get the script write. This development will have an impact on the app by making it less slow and making the game more friendly with the users of the app. </p>
