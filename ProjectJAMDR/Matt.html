									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
                                    <p> I have a strong passion for technology because of the versatile aspects it brings to my daily life. I am fascinated how technology can be utilised to create new products or services that can impact many people with minimal effort. </p>
									<p>My interest in Information technology started when I migrated to Australia. Throughout my education in Australia I have been surrounded by technology, for instance, when I got my first smartphone, I was really excited to see such a versatile device in such a small form factor. The ever-evolving of the digital world has encouraged me to learn more about technology. </p>
								<p> I chose to study at RMIT because I enjoy city life and most importantly the program I was looking for was being delivered at RMIT.  </p>
								<p> I expect to learn what employers want in graduates, thus to improve the soft and technical skills that will aid my employability in my field of study. </p>

												<p>Currently, I am studying Bachelor of Computer & Network Engineering, and therefore hold some knowledge but I am not qualified as a Network engineer yet. I do have some knowledge of operating switches and routers in a residential home network setup. Also, I do have great but not excellent, written and verbal communication skills, although this will get better as I progress throughout the years as an engineer. I have some experience in technical support, such as when friends contact me to troubleshoot their technical difficulties. Although I have no experience in designing a network, I have used engineering design processes to address and provide solutions to problems.</p>

                                <h3>Project Idea</h3>
                                <p> Overview - I have planned to create a game application that will run on Android devices. The game is targeted towards young children and adults. The game will consist of an interface where objects are constantly moving, where the user has to collect as many points as possible by pressing on the correct objects if a wrong object is pressed then the game is ended. There will be another interface that will show the leaderboard of the other players across the world. Gaining enough points will unlock special objects that will replace the original objects. </p>
                            <p> Motivation - This game is designed purely for entertainment purposes and is a great application for quick and easy play especially when people are on the go. Since the game runs offline an internet connection is not required therefore the game can be played wherever is desired. The game does require good reflexes and quick thinking ability; therefore it will be a great application for young children as their brain is still developing which might aid in their speed and accuracy of their judgments. </p>
                            <p> Description - The idea of this game is to entertain people of all ages but the game is predominately targeted towards young children and adults. The game is very simplistic and can be operated with one hand, therefore it is user-friendly for those who are on the move. <br /> This game is called “Face Smash”, the reason why is because the aim of the game is to click on certain faces’ when it appears on the screen, however tapping on the wrong face will result in the game to end. By tapping on the correct faces’ will result in the user gaining more points, however as the game progresses it is harder to click on the correct faces’ since the speed of game increases and the randomness of correct and wrong face’s get much harder. If a correct face is not clicked then the user will lose a life, each game the user is entitled to three lives. There are two bonuses that appear randomly in the game and if tapped you will possess that bonus; first bonus an extra life and second additional coins for extra points. <br /> As mentioned previously there is a point system, it is simply the longer the user lasts in the game the more points they will gain. There will be an online leaderboard from players around the world, which will rank the players with the most points collected in a single game. Having the leaderboard will give the game a competitive edge, which will encourage the user to keep playing the game so that they can reach a higher score. <br /> There will be different skins that the user can select to apply over the faces, such as a Disney theme or a Simpson’s theme. In order to use different skins the user needs to unlock it, this is done by acquiring a certain number of points in a single game which will unlock that particular skin. <br /> The nature of the game is faced paced which will require fast thinking ability. Generally, users who play the game more often will able to achieve higher scores, this may indicate that the user has strengthened the ability to process sensory information quicker into accurate decisions. <br /> The game will be available only on Android devices which the user can download it for free in the Google Play Store. </p>
                            <p> Tools & Technologies - To create the game there are two tools that will be used Unity and Visual Studios. Visual Studio will be used to code the game, the language that will be used is C#. The code created will be used to communicate to Unity which will run the game. In order to make the graphic elements of the game Photoshop and Illustrator will be used. The game will be created using 2-dimensional elements, which I am comfortable to create since I have done graphics design in the past. </p>
                            <p> Skills Required - In order to create the application, software needs to be written. Although I do have experience in writing small applications in Visual Studio, I still need to do research to acquire the skills in order to code for the game. To ascertain the skills to code the game, I will need to do plenty of research which may involve looking at sample codes or watch coding tutorials on YouTube. Since I will be using Unity as a tool to construct the game, I will need to gain a good understanding of how to use the program, which will involve watching tutorials. Once the game has been built, the application needs to be tested, this can be done in Unity itself. The game needs to be available on Android, therefore a Google account registered as an Android Developer at a cost of $25 USD will be created so that the game can be published onto the Google Play Store. To test the game from the Google Play Store, I will need an Android device, which I happen to have. </p>
                           <p> Outcome - If the application does become successful the world will not be impacted. However, if the application is very popular, users at school may talk about this game and may even be playing it during school hours which could be detrimental to their education life. Also, some users may even become addicted to the game, which at a developer point of view may sound great; it could impact the user’s social life or create family issues. Considering the simplicity of the game and that it can be played with one hand, it is very appropriate for users that are on the move. </p>
